	<h1>spousify</h1>
	<p>Hi OVO, here is a little demo I have made for you to show you how I meet some of your reqs. Spousify is a <b>node.js</b> web-app built on top of the <b>Google Admin Directory API</b>. It lets you generate some random users and add them to the Google Admin console. You can then see who the users are, and delete them if you like. The main feature is Spousify which automatically weds each user with another to speed up the marriage process. The code is <a href="https://github.com/jopfre">here on <b>github</b></a> if you want to take a look.
